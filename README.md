# Mamook Lapeep (Let’s Chat)

Mamook Lapeep (Let’s Chat) is an interactive AI media installation featuring five collaborating
artists (Indigenous & Anglo / Chinese / Argentinian settlers) offering to make trade with the
public. The trading activity will posit the fundamental question of exchange in the trade
language of Chinook Jargon: Khata Maika Ticky? (What do you want?) and, Khata Maika Iskum?
(What do you have to offer?).

The work of the five artists, Jai Sun Kang Djwa, Karin Lee, Russell Wallace, Pablo Duboue and
Nicola Harwood, will be approaching issues such as Indigenous language renewal, half and half
identity, settler relationship to land, conflict among immigrant groups, our relationship to the
truth of Canadian history and our responsibility to reconciliation. Through artist trade exchanges
with the audience participants, we will express both our gifts and our needs in relation to this
hybrid community called, “Canada.”

Questions at the core of the project include, how do we define honourable trade in light of the
dishonourable history of colonization? What exchanges can we offer one another that can fall
outside the imperative of free market capitalism? How can we get beneath the surface to
acknowledge our true needs as a community? How can we, like the creation of Chinook jargon,
communicate across our differences and come to some new understanding of both each other’s
gifts and needs? If we choose to trade together, what future responsibility do we have to one
another?

Emerging from the metaphor of the trade language of Chinook Jargon (Wawa - a trade language
widely used on the Pacific Coast and Interior of B.C. during first contact), Mamook Lapeep will
offer audience participants an opportunity to enter into a trade exchange with the artist of their
choice. Trade value will be established through a system of evaluation determined through the
programmed AI. Once a trade offered from the audience/participant is determined as desirable,
a creative exchange will take place, the audience/participant will submit their trade and then
receive access to the artists’ work. In this way, the project will enable participants to contribute
their own gifts to the data bank– creating a composite community avatar that will grow in
complexity as viewers contribute. This future community avatar that will then be reviewed,
programmed and available for the next iteration of the project.
